# apollo-healthbot

### Introduction 
Apollo the Healthbot aims to make it easier for those hosting events to perform screenings, providing Discord server owners with a bot that let's users perform screenings in the server itself.

### Inspiration
Having thrown a hackathon and faced the challenge of collecting screenings from an outsourced website, we decided to make a tool that would make it easier for server owners such as ourselves to collect screenings.

Python, Discord API
